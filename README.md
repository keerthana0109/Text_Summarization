# Text_Summarization
In this Project, we would create a Neural Network that can able to Summarize or shortent the Article using NLP

# Abstract:
Due to the plethora of data available today, text summarization has become very essential to gain just the right amount of information from huge texts. We see long articles in news websites, blogs, customers' review websites, and so on. This review paper presents various approaches to generate summary of huge texts. Various papers have been studied for different methods that have been used so far for text summarization. Mostly, the methods described in this paper produce Abstractive (ABS) or Extractive (EXT) summaries of text documents. Query-based summarization techniques are also discussed. The paper mostly discusses about the structured based and semantic based approaches for summarization of the text documents. Various datasets were used to test the summaries produced by these models, such as the CNN corpus, DUC2000, single and multiple text documents etc.
 We have studied these methods and also the tendencies, achievements, past work and future scope of them in text summarization as well as other fields.
 
# Introduction
The World Wide Web has brought us a
vast amount of on-line information. Due
to this fact, everytime someone searchs
something on the Internet, the response
obtained is lots of different Web pages with
many information, which is imposible for a
person to read completely. Although the
attempts to generate automatic summaries
began 50 years ago, in the recent years
the field of automatic Text Summarization
(TS) has experienced an exponential
growth due to these new
tecnologies.
This project addresses the current state-ofthe-art of Text Summarization.
